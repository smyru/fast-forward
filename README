This is an Opera extension - likely compatible with bare Chromium as well,
though untested - that implements quick navigation feature of the old
beloved Opera known as Fast Forward. It predicts, what link gonna be visited
next and upon hitting Space bar to scroll page, automatically loads the
next detected URL.

So far implemented:

rel link/a(nchor) tags reader
* content script requiring browsing sites access

Seeks for links with specific inner text content and so do titles
* special case look for older / previous (historical next) links
  for sinking content use case, think blogs.
* poor localization coverage though
* also requires browsing sites access
